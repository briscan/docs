# BRI Tokenomics

Currently, the BRI token supply is set to follow a **mildly inflationary model**.

With each new block created every 3 seconds on BRI, the validator who creates it, and the delegators who staked with them, receive the block rewards in newly issued BRI tokens. This is designed to secure the network's [consensus mechanism](https://docs.briscan.io/general/bri-network-blockchain/bri-consensus).

The main reason for choosing an inflationary model at the early development stage was to ensure a certain predictability of the flow of revenue for network validators and delegators. If they had to exclusively rely on transaction fees as the reward for staking BRI and validating, it would be harder for them to predict their future returns, as transaction activity on the network can fluctuate a lot. The relative predictability of validator revenue is an important assumption behind the blockchain consensus theory on which the BRI consensus mechanism is based.

Having substantial block rewards also makes it possible to keep transaction fees on the network low, facilitating adoption of BRI.
