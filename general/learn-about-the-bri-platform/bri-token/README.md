# BRI Coin (BRI)

The BRI coin is the native currency of the BRI blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.

## BRI utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the BRI blockchain, BRI is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake BRI to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 70,000. The network is growing ([https://status.briscan.io/](https://status.briscan.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BRI. Which means validators with higher amounts of BRI staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BRI holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BRI they wish. They receive a share of the BRI block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 5% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BRI is the native currency on BRI, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BRI transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BRI tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the BRI platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.
