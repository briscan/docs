# The BRI Blockchain

## Network Overview and Key Metrics

BRI is the decentralized EVM-compatible public blockchain that powers the BRI platform and ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of BRI.

The BRI blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) for achieving [consensus](https://docs.briscan.io/general/bri-network-blockchain/bri-consensus). The consensus is secured by a significant number of independent validators, only one of which is run by the BRI core team.

Validators are also responsible for the most important type of governance on BRI, namely, adopting the network protocol changes via [BRI Improvement Proposals](https://docs.briscan.io/general/fips) (FIPs).

The native token of the network is called BRI. New BRI tokens are issued with every added block and are also use to pay for gas, just like ETH on Ethereum.

The BRI blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on BRI is around 3 seconds, and it currently costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.
